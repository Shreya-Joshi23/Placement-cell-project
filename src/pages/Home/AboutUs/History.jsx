            IHemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, was established as a
            State University vide U. P. State Government notification no.
            (10)/(865)/15/(75)(85)/64 dated 23 November 1973. It has a rare
            distinction of taking birth through a powerful and popular movement
            during the early 1970s. This movement symbolized the hopes and
            aspirations of the masses for the development of higher education
            institutions in the Garhwal region. The people of this remote
            mountain region struggled for opening a University in the small but
            historic semi-rural town of Srinagar, Garhwal. It was an expression
            of the quest for empowering their future generations to overcome
            endemic economic and social backwardness, geographic and
            environmental constraints, preserving cultural identity, and
            harnessing the human resources for development.
            Proof-of-year-of-establishment.pdf The HNBGU was converted to a
            Central University on 15th January 2009 by an Act of Parliament i.e.
            The Central Universities Act 2009. The University has thus been
            entrusted with new responsibilities to guide its students, faculty
            and all other stakeholders to achieve excellence in academics and

            inception, the University has shown commitment towards regional and
            community development inherent in its teaching courses, research
            agenda and other outreach and extension initiatives. The synergy
            derived from the circumstances of its genesis still inspires and
            promotes its vision for the future. However, being a Central
            University, HNBGU has a Pan-India appeal and draws students from
