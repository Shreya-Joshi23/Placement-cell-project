# College Placement Cell Platform

This project is a comprehensive College Placement Cell platform designed to streamline the placement process for both students and administrators. The platform enables students to easily apply for and view job openings, while providing administrators with robust tools to monitor and manage the placement status of all students.

### Key Features
- **Student Dashboard**:
  - Students can apply for job openings, view their placement status (Applied, Interview, Placed), and update their profiles.
  
- **Administrator Dashboard**:
  - Administrators have full control over company operations with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing company listings and job openings.

### Future Enhancements
- **Company Signup**:
  - Companies will be able to sign up, create profiles, and post job opportunities directly on the platform.
